Projects:
=====
* **PhantomNet - end-to-end LTE/EPC testbed (Spring 2012 - Now)**    
I worked on helping to deliver functionalities in PhantomNet such as: running and testing Software
Defined Radio (SDR) eNodeB, work with OpenEPC’s source code to extend EPC protocols (e.g.,
S1 handover) in OpenEPC implementation, automating the provisioning of subscriber information
(e.g., populate HSS database with subscriber information) in EPC core network. I also created PhantomNet
profiles as packaged environments of end-to-end LTE/EPC mobile networks. The profiled
LTE/EPC networks include different combinations of: Nexus 5/simulated SDR UE/emulated UE,
SDR eNodeB/emulated eNodeB, and SDR-EPC/OpenEPC core networks. I created tutorials for the
users of PhantomNet that explain the profiles and how to use them.


* **Large scale failure detection in mobile networks (Spring 2015)**   
Despite the existing monitoring systems, there are still failures that happen without awareness of the
network operator. Those are silent failures as the operator only learn about them when customers
start to complain. Unfortunately, detecting all service disruptions is challenging. Somewhat counterintuitively,
monitoring network components is insufficient to indicate user experience because of a
complex relationship between the network status and user-perceived service experience. Moreover,
service disruptions could happen because of reasons that are beyond the network itself, e.g., a bug in
a firmware update causing all devices of a model not being able to connect.
We proposed ABSENCE, a passive service monitoring system that detects service disruptions by monitoring
customer usage. The main idea is that customer usage of a large-enough aggregation of users
is predictable. A network problem eventually manifests as a drop in customer usage. Therefore, usage
of an aggregation of customers, or lack thereof, is a reliable indicator of service disruptions or network
problems. I designed and built ABSENCE. It uses users’ Call Data Records (CDR) to obtains usage
of aggregations of customers across multiple dimensions (e.g., ZIP code, device made, model, service
types). From the usage time series, ABSENCE uses the time decomposition technique to predict future
usage and infers an anomaly if the usage is less than expected. ABSENCE uses Map-Reduce to aggregate
users in parallel from Tera-Bytes of CDR generated constantly in the network. ABSENCE was
able to detect failures with up to 95% of accuracy within the first hour of outage. It was deployed on
a Hadoop cluster with 200 nodes in the operator and detected real failures that went under the radar.

* **Novel SDN-based mobile edge cloud architecture for a massive number of Internet-ofThings
devices (Spring 2016)**   
By 2020, there are 26 billions of IoT devices (source: Gartner). A large portion of them will use the
mobile network because of the large coverage and the better security. However, the current EPC core
network was designed to support a limited number of devices streaming high-quality traffic (e.g., smart
phones streaming a Youtube video), but not a large amount of devices sending small and sporadic
traffic (e.g., billions of IoT devices sending a few bytes every 15 minutes).
I proposed SIMECA, a SDN-based mobile edge cloud architecture that provides a new network service
abstraction that is more suitable for IoT devices. Unlike LTE/EPC data plane that uses GPRS tunnels
(GTP) and maintains per device state in the core network (i.e., SGW, PGW), SIMECA’s data plane
only maintain per device state at the base station. This helps reduce SIMECA’s control plane overhead
because connection set up only requires installing classification rules at the base station. To reduce
packet header overhead, SIMECA translate packet header at base station without adding extra GTP
header into it. The header translation mechanism also allows SIMECA to separate device identity and
routing identity and support seamless mobility. I implemented SIMECA by extending OpenAirInterface’s
SDR eNodeB’s data plane and OpenEPC’s MME implementation. I evaluated SIMECA using
real SDR hardware and smart phones. Compared to LTE/EPC, SIMECA’s control plane and data
planes are 20% and 37% less overhead respectively.

* **Enhancing availability of NFV-based mobile networks in public clouds (Spring 2017)**     
With technology advancements in SDN and NFV, next generation mobile networks are expected to run
on Commodity Off-the-shelf (OTS) hardware. However, in contrast to telecom-grade hardware with
built-in redundancy (five 9s availability), commodity Off-the-Shell (COTS) hardware wasn’t built with
reliability (often guarantee three 9s availability).
We proposed ECHO, a mobile core architecture that uses existing distributed systems techniques to
improve availability of the software-based mobile core network running on an unreliable infrastructure.
ECHO is designed to scale, to be highly available despite failures while behaving exactly like the EPC
core network that runs on reliable hardware. ECHO is general as its operation does not depend on the
correctness of the LTE/EPC protocols that also constantly change.
ECHO proposes to decouple state from computation in the mobile core components; stateless redundant
computation instances and replicated state storage. ECHO leverage a necessarily reliable agent at each
base station that keeps sending a request until it receives a reply. Under duplication of requests and
failures, ECHO needs to (i) assure atomic state change on each EPC component and across components,
and (ii) maintain in-order execution of requests issued by the mobile device. To achieve atomic state
change, ECHO uses a non-blocking algorithm with Optimistic Concurrency Control to ensure only one
stateless instance can make progress. To achieve in-order execution, ECHO tags a sequence ID to each
request at the agent at the base station and ensures ECHO’s EPC components execute the requests in
the order that is specified by the sequence ID. I implemented ECHO and evaluated it on PhantomNet
and Microsoft Azure with real LTE small cells and a mobile smart-phones. ECHO can achieve five 9s
availability with 10% of overhead.

* ***Offloading architecture in mobile network using Software-defined network (Fall 2014)**    
4G mobile core networks are largely based on proprietary and expensive hardware components that
limit both new functionalities as well as low latency applications. SMORE is an SDN-based offloading
architecture for LTE/EPC network. Using an SDN infrastructure and an SDN controller, together
with a proper monitoring mechanism, SMORE offloads a portion of LTE traffic to a local edge cloud
to support low latency applications. The challenges of SMORE are to find a practical solution given
the current deployment of the mobile network and to be transparent to existing LTE traffic. SMORE
intercepts data and control plane traffic at Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO). It monitors
the LTE control channel to extract data plane information used in data plane offloading. It offloads
registered traffic to the mobile edge cloud and leaves normal LTE traffic untouched. I implemented
SMORE’s SDN controller (using Ryu) and SMORE’s monitor (using tshark).

* **Understanding TCP performance in LTE/EPC mobile networks (Fall 2014)**    
Because of the closed nature of mobile networks, many studies treat the network as a black-box and try
to probe the network from the outside to learn insights about it. In this project we wanted to look under
the hood to understand how LTE/EPC’s network protocols and procedures could potentially cause
problems with TCP performance. By extending the LTE module in the NS3 simulator, I conducted
experiments to compare TCP performance in two types of handover: lossless handover and seamless
handover. I also conducted experiments to study the impact of sudden load increase on a cell on TCP
performance. My first finding is that lossless handover imposes no packet loss during a handover however
incurs high end-to-end delay because of queue forwarding, while seamless handover causes many
packet loss but does not increase the end-to-end delay because the forwarding queue is discarded during
a handover. The second finding is that a sudden load increase at a base station could cause a sudden
bandwidth throttle of other devices in that base station. That sudden bandwidth throttle causes a
sudden delay peak at the TCP level and TCP spurious timeouts. Those TCP spurious timeouts could
cause the TCP congestion window to drop to near zero and affect TCP performance. The findings
suggest cross-layer interaction between end-devices and the mobile network to maximize applications’
performance.

I successfully defended my PhD in December 2017. My PhD dissertation was "Enhancing scalability and reliablility in mobile core networks". 
I am currently at Charter Communications' Advanced Engineering in Denver CO working on network orchestration. 

I am interested in Mobile Networking, Software-defined Networking and Distributed Systems. When at the University of Utah, I worked with Kobus who was my advisor. I was also a member of the Flux Research Group. Besides my research, I also worked on the PhantomNet testbed and SafeEdge.

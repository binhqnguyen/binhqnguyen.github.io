I successfully defended my PhD in December 2017. My PhD dissertation was ["Enhancing scalability and reliablility in mobile core networks"](https://www.flux.utah.edu/paper/271). 
I am currently at Charter Communications' Advanced Engineering in Denver CO working on network orchestration. 

I am interested in **Mobile Networking, Software-defined Networking and Distributed Systems**. 
When at the University of Utah, I worked with [Kobus](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus). 
I also contributed to the [PhantomNet testbed](http://www.phantomnet.org/) (previous effort of the [POWDER](https://powderwireless.net/) city-scale wireless testbed).
